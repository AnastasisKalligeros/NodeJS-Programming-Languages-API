# NodeJS-Programming-Languages-API

A project that was developed as a postgraduate assignment for the master's degree in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence in the subject "Advanced Programming Full Stack JavaScript Frameworks".

The project was implemented in javascript and as a development tool Visual Studio Code was chosen. A website with dynamic content was developed using nodejs and JavaScript , which is powered by a JSON file. There was no front-end involvement. Additionally a nodejs server was created which displays at a specific url an entire json file and based on the id specific elements of the json file. </br> </br>

<b>Specifically the application will support the following functions: </b> </br> </br>

There is a json file containing all the programming languages known.

1.  These languages are read from the file.
2.  Loaded into a web page either all or one by id.
3.  Two screenshots are given below where the first one loads the entire json file and the second one loads only one programming language.  </br> </br>

<b>Here are typical screenshots of the functionality:  </b> </br> </br>
